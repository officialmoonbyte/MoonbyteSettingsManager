# MoonbyteSettingsManager
A settings manager to keep track of stored information in C# applications.

All of my repos has been moved to my private repository. To contribute, please view https://repository.moonbyte.net/braydel/MoonbyteSettingsManager

All of my repositories are still online, but I recently had a project where I needed branch protection and I was not willing to pay github for it.
